## ‚ú® Main Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login system to protect application access. (New user registration functionality is planned but pending full frontend implementation).
- **Client Management (CRUD):**
    - Create, read, update, and delete client profiles.
    - Storage of contact information and relevant notes.
- **Appointment Management (CRUD):**
    - Schedule new appointments associated with clients.
    - View appointments on an interactive calendar (month and agenda views).
    - Edit existing appointment details (date, time, duration, artist, description, price, payment status).
    - Mark appointments as completed, canceled, or no-shows.
    - Control scheduling conflicts when booking or modifying appointments.
- **Expense Management (CRUD):**
    - Register new expenses with description, amount, category, and date.
    - List, edit, and delete existing expenses. (Associating expenses with a specific `user_id` is commented out in the backend code and could be implemented in the future).

    - Financial summary of the current month (income, expenses, profit).
    - Total client count and appointments for the current day.
    - List of appointments scheduled for today.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended, v18.x or higher as per backend and frontend `package.json`)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js) or Yarn
- PostgreSQL (installed and a server running)

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running in your local environment:

### 1. Clone the Repository

bash
git clone [https://github.com/AlexJ236/Gestor-de-Citas-para-Estudio-de-Tatuajes-TOPARPA-TATTOO.git](https://github.com/AlexJ236/Gestor-de-Citas-para-Estudio-de-Tatuajes-TOPARPA-TATTOO.git) TOPARPA_GESTION
cd TOPARPA_GESTION

(Note: The repository will be cloned into a folder named TOPARPA_GESTION in the command above, then you cd into it. Adjust if you prefer a different local folder name.)

2. Backend Configuration

Bash
cd backend
npm install

Create a .env file in the root of the /backend folder and configure the following environment variables:

Fragmento de c√≥digo

DB_USER=your_postgres_user
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=toparpa_tattoo_db
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
DB_PORT=5432
JWT_SECRET=a_very_long_and_hard_to_guess_secret_for_jwt # CHANGE THIS!
PORT=5001
Database Configuration:
Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running.

Create a database with the name you specified in DB_DATABASE (e.g., toparpa_tattoo_db).

IMPORTANT: Execute the provided SQL script (or one you have created) to define the table structure in your database. This script should include:

users: id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY), username (VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL), password_hash (VARCHAR NOT NULL), created_at (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP).
clients: id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY), name (VARCHAR NOT NULL), phone (VARCHAR), email (VARCHAR UNIQUE), notes (TEXT), created_at (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), updated_at (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP).
appointments: id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY), client_id (INTEGER REFERENCES clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE), user_id (INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)), appointment_time (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL), duration_minutes (INTEGER DEFAULT 60), description (TEXT), artist (VARCHAR), total_price (NUMERIC(10,0)), amount_paid (NUMERIC(10,0) DEFAULT 0), payment_status (VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending'), status (VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'scheduled'), deposit_paid_at (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE), completed_at (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE), created_at (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP). (Consider adding updated_at to appointments as well if you haven't already).
expenses: id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY), description (VARCHAR NOT NULL), amount (NUMERIC(10,0) NOT NULL), category (VARCHAR), expense_date (DATE NOT NULL), user_id (INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) NULL), created_at (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP), updated_at (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP). (The user_id column in expenses is optional and not currently actively used in the backend's creation logic).
Example of how to run an SQL script with psql (replace placeholders):

Bash
psql -U your_postgres_user -d toparpa_tattoo_db -f path/to/your/tables_script.sql

3. Frontend Configuration

Bash
cd ../frontend
npm install

The frontend is configured to connect to the backend at http://localhost:5001/api. If you need to change this, modify the frontend/src/services/api.js file.

‡∂∞ Available Scripts
From the /backend folder:

npm start: Starts the backend server in production mode.
npm run dev: Starts the backend server in development mode with nodemon (auto-restarts on changes).

From the /frontend folder:
npm run dev: Starts the frontend development server (usually at http://localhost:5173).
npm run build: Compiles the frontend application for production (in the /frontend/dist folder).
npm run lint: Runs ESLint to analyze the frontend code.
npm run preview: Serves the production build locally for preview.

üîë Authentication
Authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Upon login, the backend generates a token that the frontend stores in sessionStorage.
All subsequent requests to protected API routes from the frontend include this token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.
The backend verifies this token to authorize access.
The new user registration functionality (POST /api/auth/register) is implemented in the backend (authController.js), but the frontend call (authService.js) is marked as TODO, and there is currently no user interface for it.

üìÑ API Endpoints (Summary)
